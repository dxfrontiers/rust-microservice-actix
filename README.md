# rust-microservice-actix
This is the source code for our [Blog Post](https://blog.digitalfrontiers.de/microservices-in-rust-with-actix-a61bb62fee80).

Although the service is rather incomplete, you might find some of the implemented patterns useful.

To run it yourself, you need to have a postgres installation set up and the ~~[management service](https://.)~~(coming soon) running.

The service exposes metrics that can be scraped by prometheus out of the box.
